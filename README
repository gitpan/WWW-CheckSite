README for WWW::CheckSite 0.018
===============================
This program will spider from the specified url and check the
availability of the links, images and stylesheets on each page. Pages
and stylesheets are also validated with the validators available at
http://validator.w3.org and http://jigsaw.w3.org.

When all pages are checked two 'kwalitee' reports in HTML-format are
generated. The "full.html" report contains all the information for all
pages and the "summ.html" report contains only the pages with errors
and their errors.
