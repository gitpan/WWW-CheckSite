=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 Kwalitee

The idea behind this package is to provide an analysis of items
contained in a web-site. We use the word I<kwalitee> because it looks
and sounds like I<quality> but just isn't. The metrics used to assess
I<kwalitee> only give an indication of the technical state a web-site is
in, and do not reflect on the user experience of I<quality> of that web-site.

At the heart of the package is the I<spider> that fetches all the pages
referred to within the web-site. For each page that is fetched a number of
things is checked. Here is an explanation of the kwalitee metrics:

=over 4

=item B<* return status>

The most basic check for a web-page is to see if it can be fetched. The
HTTP return-status should be B<200 OK>.

SCORE: 0 for return status other than 200; 1 for return status 200

=item B<* title>

The next check is to see if the C<< <title></title> >> tag-pair has content.

SCORE: 0 for not content; 1 for content

=item B<* valid>

The next check is to see if the (X)HTML in the page validates. The
default behaviour is to use the validator available on
L<http://validator.w3.org>

SCORE: 0 for not valid, 1 for valid or validation disabled

=item B<* links>

The next check is to see if the web-page does not contain "dead links".

All hyperlinks (C<< <a href=>, <area href=> >>) are checked with a
HTTP I<HEAD> request to see if they can be "followed". URLs that have
the same origin as the primary url will also be put on the
"to-fetch-list" of the spider.

MAX SCORE: 1 (do not count urls excluded by robot-rules/exclude pattern)

=item * B<images>

The next check is to see if the web-page does not contain "dead images".

All images (C<< <img src=>, <input type=image> >>) are checked with a
HTTP I<HEAD> request to see if they exist on the server. If the
L<Image::Info> module is available, the image is fetched from the
server and a basic sanity test on the image is done.

MAX SCORE: 1 (do not count images excluded by robot-rules/exclude pattern)

=item * B<styles>

The next check is to see if the web-page does not contain "dead style
references".

All styles referenced in C<< <link rel=stylesheet type=text/css> >>
are fetched and if validation is switched on, they will be sent to the
css-validator at: L<http://jigsaw.w3.org/validator>

TODO: Extract inline styles, and send them of for validation.

MAX SCORE: 1

=item B<kwalitee>

Every individual page can have a maximum of B<6> kwalitee points that
lead to a I<kwalitee> of B<1.00>. For the complete web-site the mean of
the page scores is taken and presented as a fraction of 1.

=back

=head2 checksite

This script is a wrapper around L<WWW::CheckSite> that supports some
command-line options to tweak the behaviour of the module.

Here is an explanation of these options:

=over 4

=item B<< [--uri|-u] <uri> >> (mandatory unless --load)

This specifies the uri to be spidered. The I<--uri> option-qualifier
is optional. I<--uri> can be abbreviated to I<-u>.

=item B<< --prefix|-p <prefix> >> (mandatory)

This option specifies a prefix that will be used as a subdirectory
name which is used to store the saved spider data and the
reports. I<--prefix> can be abbreviated to I<-p>.

The subdirectory is created the current directory, or in the directory
specified with the I<--dir> option. The data stored as a result of the
I<--save> option will be in this subdirectory with the name F<<
<prefix>.wcs >>

=item B<< --dir|-d <directory> >>

This option specifies the base directory for storing the
data. I<--dir> can be abbreviated to I<-d>.

=item B<--save> or B<--nosave>

This option specifies that the spider data should be saved. The
default behaviour is to save the data, if you do not want that, use
I<--nosave>. The saved data can later be used to regenerate the
reports with the I<--load> option. The data is stored as F<<
<directory>/<prefix>/<prefix>.wcs >> with C<< Storable::nstore()
>>. I<--[no]save> cannot be abbreviated.

See also: WWW::CheckSite Report-Templates

=item B<--load>

This options specifies that you want to load the results of a previous
run and not do an actual run of the programme. This option is useful
to regenerate the reports. I<--load> cannot be abbreviated.

See also: WWW::CheckSite Report-Templates

=item B<--html> or B<--nohtml>

This option specifies if (X)HTML-validation should be done. The
default behaviour is to validate I<by_upload> (see
B<--html_upload>). If you do not want the validation, use the
I<--nohtml> option. I<--[no]html> cannot be abbreviated.

See also: checksite B<--html_uri>, B<--html_upload>, B<--xmllint> and
B<--html_validator>

=item B<< --html_validator <w3c-validator-uri> >>

B<As of version 0.20, the (X)HTML-validator at W3C is no longer used
as the validator for (X)HTML as they do not allow robots!>

The default w3c-validator-uri is now
C<http://localhost/w3c-validator/>. It is strongly advised to run your
own copy of the W3C validator. I<--html_validator> cannot be
abbreviated.

The W3C (X)HTML-validator is widly available and runs smoothly on most
systems with Apache and Perl running. See
L<http://validator.w3.org/source/> for more information.

=item B<--html_uri>

This option sets the validation method to use the uri interface
(unless I<--nohtml> is specified). You can optionally specify an
alternative (X)HTML-validator site with
B<--html_validator>. I<--html_uri> cannot be abbreviated.

=item B<--html_upload>

This option sets the validation method to use the upload interface
(unless I<--nohtml> is specified). All the content to be validated is
saved as a local file (using L<File::Temp>). I<--html_upload> cannot be
abbreviated.

=item B<< --xmllint <path/to/xmllint> >>

This option specifies that the validation of (X)HTML should be done
the L<xmllint(1)> program (unless I<--nohtml> is specified). You can
optionally specify the full path to your xmllint program. I<--xmllint>
cannot be abbreviated.

=item B<--css> or B<--nocss>

This option specifies if CSS-validation should be done. The
default behaviour is to validate I<by_upload> (see
B<--css_upload>). If you do not want the validation, use the
I<--nocss> option. I<--[no]css> cannot be abbreviated.

See also: checksite B<--css_uri>, B<--css_upload> and
B<--css_validator>

=item B<< --css_validator <css-validator-uri> >>

B<As of version 0.20, the CSS-validator at W3C is no longer used
as the validator for CSS as they do not allow robots!>

The default w3c-validator-uri is now
C<http://localhost/css-validator/>. It is strongly advised to run your
own copy of the W3C validator. I<--css_validator> cannot be
abbreviated.

The W3C CSS-validator is available and runs under Jigsaw on most
systems with a working java JDK. See
L<http://www.w3.org/Jigsaw/#Getting> for more information on Jigsaw
applet server, and L<http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/DOWNLOAD.html>
for more information on the W3C CSS-validator.

=item B<--css_uri>

This option sets the validation method to use the uri interface
(unless I<--nocss> is specified). You can optionally specify an
alternative CSS-validator site with B<--css_validator>. I<--css_uri>
cannot be abbreviated.

=item B<--css_upload>

This option sets the validation method to use the upload interface
(unless I<--nocss> is specified). All the content to be validated is
saved as a local file (using L<File::Temp>). I<--css_upload> cannot be
abbreviated.

=item B<< --lang|-l <accept-language> >>

This option can be used to force a web-server to return web-pages in the
specified language (if applicable). The I<accept-language> argument
can be a simple two letter language code as specified in ISO 639, or a
complete Accept-language: field as described in section 14.4 of RFC
2616.

B<NOTE>: My apache config says:

  # Note 3: In the case of 'ltz' we violate the RFC by using a three
  # char specifier. There is 'work in progress' to fix this and get
  # the reference data for rfc1766 cleaned up.

So there may be more weird stuff out there, but since you are supposed
to be using this on your own web-sites only, you should know about that!

I<--lang> can be abbreviated to I<-l>.

=item B<< --ua_class <ua_class> >>

This option can be used to override the default user-agent class
L<WWW::Mechanize>. The new user-agent class could be a
I<WWW::Mechanize> descendant that caters for your special needs:

    package BA_Mech;
    # This package sets credentials for basic authentication
    use base 'WWW::Mechanize';
    sub get_basic_credentials { ( 'abeltje', '********' ) }
    1;

and call C<checksite> like

    checksite -p mysite --ua_class BA_Mech http://www.mysite.org

=item B<--verbose|-v> (multiple)

Each I<--verbose> option increases the verbosity. When C<$v==1> you
will see the messages from L<WWW::CheckSite> and when C<$v==2> you
will also see the messages from L<WWW::CheckSite::Valiadator> and
L<WWW::CheckSite::Spider>.

=begin private

=item B<--tt> or B<--nott>

This option explicitly enables or disables the use of template-toolkit
templates. I<--[no]tt> cannot be abbreviated.

=item B<--exclude pattern>

This option overwrites the deafult exclusion pattern for uri's C<[#?].+$>.

=end private

=item B<< configuration file >>

The I<checksite> program supports L<Config::Auto>. This means you can
specify any of the commandline arguments as options (without the
prefixing dashes) in a file.

The files searched are (and in this order):

=over 8

=item B<./checksiteconfig>

=item B<./checksite.config>

=item B<./checksiterc>

=item B<./.checksiterc>

=item B<< <bindir>/checksiteconfig >>

=head2 WWW::CheckSite

The L<WWW::CheckSite> module uses the L<WWW::CheckSite::Validator>
module to get information about a website and assess its
I<kwalitee>. The findings are presented in two html reports, one with
all the information and one with just the "errors".

The reports are created with the use of templates. The module caters
for two template systems: L<Template> (TT2) and L<HTML::Template>. The
template-toolkit templates are prefered if both modules are installed.

=head3 Your own report templates

The report templates have the base names: F<wcsfullrpt.EXT> and
F<wcssummrpt.EXT>, where C<EXT eq 'tt'> for template-toolkit and C<EXT
eq 'tmpl'> for L<HTML::Template>.

First the current directory is searched, then directory where
C<checksite> is installed and finally the directory where the
L<WWW::CheckSite> module is installed (and where the default templates
are). If you put your own templates in one of the first two
directories, they will override the default templates.

=head3 Saving and loading validation data

Saving the validation data can help you develop your own templates.
